# PScript (Probabilistic Script)
PScript (Probabilistic Script) is a programming language designed to facilitate the implementation and execution of probabilistic models and computations. It provides a set of syntax and constructs that allow developers to express and manipulate probabilistic distributions, statistical models, and inference algorithms in a concise and intuitive manner.

- It was build using [PLY (Python lex yacc)](https://www.dabeaz.com/ply/ply.html#ply_nn4).
- Previous work that was used to build this project can be found as [SigmaScript](https://github.com/jahelsantiago/Sigmascript), a project developed by members of the current team.


## How to use
1. Clone this repository using `git clone https://github.com/jumorap/PScript`.
2. Move into the repository using `cd PScript`. 
3. Install the required packages using `pip install -r requirements.txt`. 
4. Write code in the `scripts` folder in PScript format to use the language and save it as `<file_name>.txt`. 
5. Run your code using `python3 pscript.py scripts/<file_name>.txt -t` where `-t` is a flag to show each token generated by the lexer. 
   - You can also run the code using `python3 pscript.py scripts/<file_name>.txt` to only show the output of the program.
   - You can also run the code using `python3 pscript.py` to write and run PScript code through the terminal line by line.
