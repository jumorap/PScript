# PScript (Probabilistic Script)
PScript (Probabilistic Script) is a programming language designed to facilitate the implementation and execution of probabilistic models and computations. It provides a set of syntax and constructs that allow developers to express and manipulate probabilistic distributions, statistical models, and inference algorithms in a concise and intuitive manner.

- It was build using [PLY (Python lex yacc)](https://www.dabeaz.com/ply/ply.html#ply_nn4).
- Previous work that was used to build this project can be found as [SigmaScript](https://github.com/jahelsantiago/Sigmascript), a project developed by members of the current team.


## Features
- [x] Basic arithmetic operations
- [x] Basic logical operations
- [x] Basic conditional statements
- [x] Basic loops (while)
- [x] Basic functions
- [x] Basic multidimensional arrays 
- [x] Basic variables without type inference
- [x] Basic probability distributions (Exponential, Normal, Uniform, Poisson, Geometric)
- [x] Stochastic variables (when the variable is called, always returns different values)
- [x] Stochastic arrays (when the array is called, always returns different values)
- [x] Console input and output
- [x] File input and output un txt format with PScript syntax

## How to use
1. Clone this repository using :
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/jumorap/PScript
   ```
2. Move into the repository using:
   ```
   cd PScript
   ``` 
3. Install the required packages using:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Write PScript in the `scripts` folder and save it as `<file_name>.psc`. 
5. Run your code using :
   ```
   python3 pscript.py scripts/<file_name>.psc -t
   ```
   where `-t` is a flag to show each token generated by the lexer. 

   - To only show the output of the program you can also run the code using:
     ```
     python3 pscript.py scripts/<file_name>.psc
     ```
   - To write and run PScript code through the terminal line by line you can also run the code using: 
     ```
     python3 pscript.py
     ```

### NOTE: 
- The `scripts` folder contains some examples of PScript code.
- You can run some examples of PScript using:
  ```
  python3 pscript.py scripts/while_bucle.psc
  ```
